# Raspberry Pi Pico Ultrasonic Sensor Distance Measurement
This README provides an overview of the code used to integrate an ultrasonic sensor with a Raspberry Pi Pico to measure the distance of an object. The ultrasonic sensor utilizes sound waves to measure the distance between the sensor and an object by calculating the time taken for the sound waves to bounce back.

## Hardware Requirements:
Raspberry Pi Pico
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04 or similar)
Jumper wires
Breadboard (optional)
Wiring Instructions:
Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Raspberry Pi Pico as follows:

Ultrasonic Sensor VCC to Pico 3.3V (3V3)
Ultrasonic Sensor GND to Pico GND (GND)
Ultrasonic Sensor Trig to Pico GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO 5)
Ultrasonic Sensor Echo to Pico GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO 6)
Make sure to double-check the pin numbers and their correspondence with the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi Pico.

# Running the Code:
Make sure the hardware connections are correct as per the wiring instructions.
Copy the provided code into your Python editor (e.g., Thonny or VSCode).
Save the file as ultrasonic_distance.py and transfer it to the Raspberry Pi Pico.
Run the code on the Pico, and you should see the distance measurement printed on the console.
Please note that this is a basic example to get you started with the ultrasonic sensor integration. Depending on your application, you can extend and customize the code to suit your specific needs. Happy coding!
